        <b id="her" > chiken soup</b> <i id="her"ss>is a comfort food classic, so this creamy chicken soup is one of my Mom’s recipes that I just had to learn. Filled with chicken, celery, carrots, broth, garlic, and plenty of seasonings, the flavor is unbeatable. And thanks to heavy cream and white wine, every spoonful has the creamiest, silkiest texture. This is truly the best chicken soup recipe ever, one that our family can’t get enough of, and I hope your family loves it too!</i></p>
